<h2>At the roots of the contemporaneous: Lumetta's "cold realism"</h2>
	<p>
	There is a permanent tension in the 
   southern italian painting, almost a phisiologic fever that signs 
   differentiate routs at center of the earth and by the nature. Digging in the 
   emotions of rebound that arrive by an infested naturalistic habitat without 
   giving up of deep roots, the artist, done the debit exceptions, she finds 
   out a rethoric landscape and lyrics together, to reproduce, in uncontrolled 
   deafening accelleration, fragmented visions in the origin color: doesn't 
   giving up genetic heredity who doesn'tknow and doesn't concede that some 
   pause of tell and few controlled evasions.</p>
   
   <p>Is so that the south painting becomes often a sequence of 
    repetitive icons like conform copy, almost would urge at the doors a 
    sociologic instance, the representation of invaluable limit of another 
    world, of a unique unrepeatable morphology. it isn't a case, in fact, as we 
    talk about realism and Mediterranean natutalism -done of accentuated and 
    aggressive brightnesses combined by moments of poor and antique real life- 
    to celebrate custom, tradition and situations that have been transmitted 
    during the time and history.</p>

	<p>Then appen that, impossible to ask question about this esthetic 
    patrimonies, the first step of every meridional artist tries to redo rules 
    and true formulas which we can't forget of a remote time. Some years ago,by 
    going a cross Lumetta's works, if from one side she had to do, to be confirm 
    of a feminine painting who lived the conditioning of objective reality and 
    of a familiar world epicenter, of all emotions and right way about her tell,few 
    liberator escapes made me presage that the immutability of same series of 
    figurative works wouldn't have been leit motif of permanent and obligatory 
    direction, by that intimate diary lived in the small chronicle of feelings.
    </p>
	
	<p>Certainly the enchanted solitudes of those alone boats and stop in 
    long metaphisics silents, the tranches of the landscape run by the profiles 
    of antique ruins, the lean out of sedimented logs and branches corroded by 
    the salt and by the sea wind, the farther horizons of a green lagoon, smooth 
    and rancid were there to indicate a painting of an intense interior life, 
    without yieldingness to an easy sentimentalism, but rather concentrate in a 
    rough essential and dry figuration.</p>

	<p>The contemporaneous of those images were there in the most pure 
    tradition painting which Lumetta used to feel tight like in a straitjacket 
    for her the still waters of that calm mooring represented, in fact, a strong 
    limitation of her doing art intented like automatic and origin emergence by 
    the marmalades of artists approved by the territory. And the inevitable 
    turning point is arrived.</p>

	<p>Without to forget herself and not even getting lost by the road, in 
    an careful investigation on codes and on a scripture of painting innervated 
    and verified in the time of the image, the painter of Foggia has opened 
    daily places of memory and of new objectivity almost to practice the thought 
    of Robert Rauschenberg when he used to write "My only intention is to put 
    the people as compared with her own daily existence. And to make them to 
    observe by a different way, like if it was the first time".</p>
    
	<p>The change of speed is evident, even more the immersion in the 
    contemporaneousness. Lumetta today transforms the object in picture, she 
    opens wide the windows to the world of a new reality, she neutralizes 
    irrilevant emotion of her preceding naturalism for new presentations getting 
    and attributing new esthetic dignity to her nature: she makes her a way to 
    reread carefully, sometimes scratched, iconoclastic and estrainged, of a 
    solar and Mediterranean "popular" where the finger isn't pointed on the 
    consumeristic or serial usage but, even in the rarefied and far away to put 
    by the image, they develop sentimental temperatures, magic in their absolute 
    verism.</p>
    
	<p>We're in the territories of that "realism of the survives" which 
    not by change it is gifted of the magic adjective to find new push and 
    credibility in today's time. But the negation of cutting of light, of almost 
    photographic and precise definition, and of the composition taste of a 
    Ventrone are the Lumetta's original and new world. In the artist remain 
    alternative fleshiness, fruits, bulbs, tubers are detached of a great 
    metaphisic restlessness, they are arranged in geometries who chase each 
    other or stopped, anchored in an unreal if not impossible stand-by. In this 
    cold realism their anomalous, almost monumental and disillusioned vitalism 
    is roused: it is not a case, in fact, the work that presents two anonymous 
    peppers has been entitled "Homage to Claes Oldenburg".</p>

	<p>In effect like the masters in the "pop art" Lumetta doesn't limit 
    to repeat shapes and contents of the mass products but she choose few of the 
    more significant transferts by making them rise in one their autonomous 
    life, without literary complacences or evocative and enchanted suggestions. 
    In the main while Nature is depicted estranged ephemeral landscape, of an 
    exciting banality and of a fascinating almost surreal bewilderedly.</p>

	<p>It doesn't seem contradictory reversal of trend, at last, few 
    recent works in wich rise like protagonist ruins of antique houses, frontons 
    of temples, antiques architectonics vestiges retraced in a route between 
    fantastic diary and archeology of the emotions. The silences and the 
    solitudes of the object live the same bewilderely of that remnant memory of 
    these visions between dream and proof, between lived history and told 
    history. Like the vegetables, the flowers, the fruits of the earth live in 
    autonomous and absent their life, so these stones lived the "presence of 
    absence" and they take on strange temperatures poised between reality and 
    pretence almost to mean their improbability to exist.</p>

    <h2>Lumetta or rather about hyper-real paradox</h2>
	<p>The process of de-mythicisation to which art has been subjected throughout 
    sculpture history, in the Mediterranean area, parallel to events elsewhere, 
    leads us to believe that the most outstanding officially held assumption of 
    the concept of image, be that reached in Hellas, and after in Rome, where the 
    maximum criteria of artistic perfection decreed figurative perfection. In 
    fact, undisputedly, Greece and then Rome, where the same principle was accepted, glorified and widely 
    diffused, represent the focal points of reference geo-historically, of the 
    equation "plastic perfection equals art". This natural birthright which we 
    can define "the record of harmony"</p>
    
	<p>Even so, the elevation of classical beauty to the status of myth, doesn't alter 
    the fact that with a analysis conducted by Lucia Caricone, alias Lumetta.
    This is a result that every critic would aspire to attain. But though 
    historically, an unwritten law decrees that all language, therefore, 
    artistic expression also, should reflect the times of its foment, 
    nevertheless any attempt whatsoever at re-evaluation is overwhelmed by a 
    considerable wave of conservatism which consolidates tradition.</p>
    
	<p>Question and decide whether the sublime perfection of Lumetta, plasticity is 
    merely one of the many instances of "putting back in order" imposed by 
    history, with regard to the morphological characteristics of the botanic-subjet, 
    but also that of Europe and Italy art, already possessed by a symbological 
    expression. So, in face of the sublime perfection art, we may well ask 
    ourselves if humanity in the last four thousand years has not undergone a 
    radical and alarming degradation in its natural, vegetal harmony, or if by 
    sheer chance. Were not specialised in a kind of production of false ideology 
    and ideography and thereby, morphology and philology, the persons portrayed 
    being a sample, so to speak, of stylistic and physical harmony in their 
    agricultural product and landscape effigies.</p>
    
	<p>Lucia Caricone has avoided the conditioning of an academic mentality, which 
    is what it is in fact, thanks to an inoculation of a psychic reagent that 
    luckly motivates her to acknowledge classic art for what it is, idealism 
    being its rason d'etre a focal point of all aesthetic values, but which 
    being ideal, belongs in its own time and place, the same place where 
    rhetoric, hagiography and officialism belong. (What else is classical art if 
    not a sampler of ostentations rhetoric, hagiography, composed manners, in 
    short, a constriction in the official image?).</p>
    
	<p>The feeling must have been one of standing on the threshold in not thrust right 
    in the midst of a geo-iconologic eldorado, where of the scholastic 
    sedimentation, could be pratically touched by hand, lived as a reality to 
    the levels that modern art scales exalt them, to the status of myth, where we 
    find the leading exponents of the second half of the twentieth century. In 
    the continuous vegetable simbology, so tangible for their execution in 
    three-dimensional pictures.</p>
